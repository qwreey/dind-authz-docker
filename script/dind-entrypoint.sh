# The stock docker:dind entrypoint (dockerd-entrypoint.sh) hardcodes
# --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375, exposing the daemon on every interface
# (including code-docker-external). We want it reachable only from
# code-docker-internal instead.
#
# The container's IP on that network isn't known ahead of time (Docker
# assigns it from an auto-allocated subnet), so we can't hardcode it.
# Instead we pick it dynamically: code-docker-internal is the only
# network here with no route to the outside world, so we bind to
# whichever interface is NOT part of the default route.
#
# NOTE: this assumes exactly two networks (one with a route out, one
# without). If a third network is ever added to this service, this
# picks the first non-default, non-loopback interface it finds, which
# may need to become more specific at that point.
#
# Not racy against the routing loop below despite running before it ever
# ticks: code-docker-internal is `internal: true`, so Docker itself never
# installs a default route on it in the first place (no window where it
# transiently looks routeless-but-shouldn't-be), and a container restart
# resets the netns's routing table anyway, so no stale route from a prior
# run can linger either. In the manual code-docker-external-restored
# topology, Docker plants that network's default route synchronously as
# part of container creation - before this entrypoint (PID 1) ever starts
# executing - so this line already sees the right answer deterministically
# in that case too.
